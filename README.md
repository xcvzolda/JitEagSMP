Welcome to JitEagSMP Eaglercraft SMP. Based on Eaglercraft-1.12-Server-Hosting repo by dragon731012.
# What can i do on the server
Anything. You can build stuff in creative and such. BUT there is only one way to connect due to hosting limitations.
# How to join
Just enter https://fluffy-xylophone-g4xv49gqq76g294gj-8081.app.github.dev/ to your address bar on your browser then you need to continue past the github warning (The server software is confirmed not to collect any data about your pc or personal info) and select the ver of eaglercraft to play. We reccommend WASM-GC version since it is faster. Then select Multiplayer and select "Potato Server".
# Credit
